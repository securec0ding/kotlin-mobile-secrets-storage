val accountName = "BadApiCoAccount"

// Write code to obfuscate the account name

// Reversing a string would be very weak obfuscatation
// Here as an example, but not accepted as a solution!

val obfuscated = accountName.reversed()

// Print out a line you can paste into AppDelegate.swift
// (along with the approriate decoding code)
//
// Since this is so simple we print the code and data
//

println("val accountName = \"$obfuscated\"")
